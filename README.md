# SeqMaster

This repository contains an open-source library which make work with protein, DNA and RNA. It consists out of two main scripts. 

SeqMaster.py is capable to process multiple proteins and peptides sequences, calculate physical features, find specific sites. For nucleic acids it can transcribe, find complement sequences, reverse, calculate GC-content. Also SeqMaster supports FASTQ-format and can be used to filter DNA sequences based on their length, GC-content and sequence quality. 

bio_files_proccessor.py is a script that allow user to work with biological files in popular formats. It can convert FASTA files with multiline sequence records to oneline, find neighbour CDSs for given genes from GBK file, change starting position in FASTA file (usefull for prokaryotic genomes) and find descriptions for best BLAST results. All results are saved in new folders in the same directory with input files.

### Sequence tools

This section contains description of functions you can find in our library.

#### DNA and RNA tools

This function allows you to perform various operations on nucleic acid sequences. Pass comma-separated sequences as the first arguments, followed by an additional argument (if required by the specific function), and specify the function name you want to apply to all sequences. Make sure to provide arguments strictly in this order.

##### Usage

`run_dna_rna_tools(*args, seq_type = 'DNA')`

**seq_type**:
- type of desired complementary sequence
- by default has value 'DNA'
- only supported values are 'DNA' and 'RNA'

##### Operations

- `nucl_acid_identity` - shows the type of given sequences; if sequence cannot be identified as `'DNA'` or `'RNA'` it will be given name `'uncertain'`
